Getting into RTR scripting


* add my Rekall / yara scrtipts ( full powershell )
* search / find a IR powershell script ( I have url some place ... I just can't find it .. )
* https://github.com/KurtDeGreeff/PlayPowershell ( add anything cool from here )
* RTR to zip all the info up and pull it down ( some code I saw for this some place .. ? )
